3. Configure the Printer via CUPS Web Interface
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:631.

Click on the "Administration" tab.

Under "Printers," click "Add Printer."

You should see your Canon LBP3010 listed. Select it and click "Continue."

Follow the prompts to configure the printer. You may need to select the appropriate driver (look for Canon LBP3010 or similar).

Once configured, you can print a test page to verify that the printer is working.

4. Troubleshooting
USB Connection Issues: Ensure the printer is properly connected via USB and recognized by the system. You can check this by running lsusb in the terminal.

Driver Issues: If the printer doesn't work with the cnijfilter2 driver, you might need to try other Canon drivers available in nixpkgs.

Permissions: Ensure your user is in the lp group to manage printers.
